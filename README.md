## Assignment:
## PROBLEM:

### Headless (no UI) CMS for managing articles (CRUD).
* Each article has its ID, title, body and timestamps (on creation and update).
* Managing articles is the typical set of CRUD calls including reading one and all the articles.
* Creating/updating/deleting data is possible only if a secret token is provided (can be just one static token).
* For reading all the articles, the endpoint must allow specifying a field to sort by including whether in an ascending or descending order + basic limit/offset pagination.
* The whole client-server communication must be in a JSON format and be ready to be extended with other formats (eg. XML).
Keep in mind the best practices for building flexible server applications including automated testing.
### Technical Requirements:
* Python 3.6+
* Falcon/Flask/FastAPI
* Automated tests
* REST API + documentation
* Relational Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, ...) * README
* Docker

## SOLUTION:

/article
* GET
* POST
  
/article/{article_id}
* GET
* PATCH
* DELETE
